Hi, I’m Joan Baptista (AKA Johnny B. Goode R'n'R) and I am <b>TRYING</b> to learning Git.

I was born in 1971, I use computers since mid 80's, I was an ITC professional from 1989 until 2012,
working as RPG-II, Clipper and later, Visual Basic 5/6 developer only from 1989 until 1999.

Tria Sistema Operatiu is the first Free Software Project I started alone, in the summer of 2020.

Please, be patience with my slow learning of Git. I have 2 good teachers, but not so many time to learn. Thank you very much.
